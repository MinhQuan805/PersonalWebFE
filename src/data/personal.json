      "As a kid, I was passionate about reading books about geniuses like Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, and Stephen R. Covey. They all changed the world ‚Äî but what about me? I was just an ordinary, shy boy, often considered 'useless' and unreliable.",
      "Do you know the feeling of being underestimated by talented people, or being taken advantage of for being too kind? I‚Äôve been through it all. It made me ask myself: 'Why can‚Äôt I be better?'",
      "Then one day, I came across a quote that changed my life from Jim Rohn: 'Don‚Äôt wish it were easier, wish you were better.'",
      "From that moment, I decided to change. In every project, I give my best so that I have no regrets, even if I fail.",
      "Now, my life philosophy is simple: Always strive to bring maximum satisfaction to everyone who walks with me."
